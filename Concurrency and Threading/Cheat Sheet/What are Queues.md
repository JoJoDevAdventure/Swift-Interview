# Concurrency & Threads : 

## What is concurrency? 

Concurrency is doing multiple tasks in the same time. 

The more cores you have, the more tasks you can execute at  the same time.  

Threads are like the path that tasks take.

## There are two types of threads: 

### Main   Background

#### Main thread:  
Fast, For UI, light tasks..
#### Back thread:
Slower, For heavy tasks...
